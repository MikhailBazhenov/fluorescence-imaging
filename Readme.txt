This is a batch image measurement program (BIMP-F) that was used to measure the area of increased fluorescence in plant leaves caused by droplets of bentazone herbicide.

To use BIMP-F, place the BIMP-F.py file in a folder containing the images you want to process and then run it. 

At the first run, it will prompt you to install any necessary Python libraries.
